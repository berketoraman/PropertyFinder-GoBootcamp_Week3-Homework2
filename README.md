# Property Finder - Go Bootcamp Week3 Homework2

- Please study Ch07 of GoPL book.
- Create a rectangle abstraction using struct. Create two functions to calculate area and circumference of given rectangle instance and set produced values   on given rectangle instance. Create another function to create an instance of rectangle struct and return it. But that function would be able to return     an error in case of passing invalid arguments such as negative length or height. Choose one of strategies mentioned i the text book and exemplified in      error.go of ch 05 in example project.   
- Implement a number-guessing game in which the computer computes a four digit number as a secret number and a player tries to guess that number correctly.   Player would enter her guess and the computer would produce a feedback on the positions of the digits. Four-digit number can't start with 0 and have       repeating digits. Let's say the computer computes 2658 as a secret number to be guessed by the player. When player enters her guess such as 1234, the       computer would display -1 meaning that only one digit of 1234 exist in the secret number and its position is wrong. When the player enters 5678 the         similarly the computer displays +2-1. And the game goes on until the player correctly guess the secret number and the computer displays +4. The game also   keeps track of all guesses entered by the players so far and lists them when it displays its feedback to the player so that the player can compute her      next guess correctly.
- Try to understand and run examples in following chapters of the repo
